This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the component tries to render before the data has arrived.

```javascript
// Bug: Trying to access a property of an undefined object
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUserData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{userData.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
